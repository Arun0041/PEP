Time Complexity : how much time an algorithm takes as input size increases

Big O -> Represents the upper  bound of running time, it gives the worst case scanerio for an algorithm, it describe the maximum time an algorithm takes 

1. O(1): constant time-> the time taken does not depend on the input of algorithm
2. O(log n): logarathmic time-> the time grows logarathmically as the input size increases, often seen in algorithm that divide input into half;
3. O(n): Linear time-> the time grows directly Propotional to input Size();
4. O(n log n) : Linearithmic Time -> mix of linear and Linearithmic;
5. O(n^2): Quadratic Time-> the time grows Propotional to the
